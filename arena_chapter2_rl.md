## Chapter 2: Reinforcement Learning - Teaching Machines to Make Decisions

This chapter dives into the exciting world of Reinforcement Learning (RL), empowering you to build agents that can learn to interact with environments and make optimal decisions to maximize rewards. Building upon the deep learning foundation from the previous chapters, it explores core RL concepts, algorithms, and their practical applications, culminating in the cutting-edge technique of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).

**Section 1: Intro to RL - Navigating the World of Agents and Environments**

This section lays the groundwork for understanding the core concepts and fundamental algorithms of reinforcement learning. It establishes the key components of the RL framework: agents, environments, actions, rewards, and policies.

* **Multi-Armed Bandit:**
    * Revisits the multi-armed bandit problem, this time in a more formal setting, introducing:
        * The **OpenAI Gym library** - a standard interface for interacting with various RL environments.
        * The structure of a `gym.Env`, including methods like `step`, `reset`, and `render` to interact with and visualize the environment.
        * Discrete action and observation spaces, where the agent has a finite set of choices and receives discrete observations.
        * The **`info` dictionary** -  used by environments to provide additional information not part of the standardized interface (e.g., debugging information).
    * You'll implement various agents for the multi-armed bandit problem, starting with a basic `RandomAgent` to validate the environment setup and progressing to more sophisticated agents that learn to maximize rewards using:
        * **Reward Averaging:**  Keeps track of the average reward received for each arm and chooses arms based on these estimates. Explores the role of **optimism** in encouraging exploration.
        * **UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) Action Selection:**  Balances exploration and exploitation by choosing arms that maximize an upper confidence bound on their potential rewards.
    * The section emphasizes the importance of **exploration vs. exploitation** in RL, introducing the concept of an **epsilon-greedy policy** to balance these two objectives.
    * It also highlights the inherent **variability in RL performance** due to randomness and the challenges of reliably measuring and comparing agent performance.
* **Tabular RL & Policy Improvement:**
    * Provides a more formal introduction to RL concepts, covering:
        * **Markov Processes:**  Environments where the future state depends only on the current state and action, not on past history.
        * **Value Function:**  A function that estimates the expected cumulative reward the agent can achieve from a given state, following a particular policy.
        * **Bellman Equation:**  A recursive equation that relates the value of a state to the values of its successor states, capturing the core principle of dynamic programming in RL.
    * Introduces methods for **policy evaluation** and **policy improvement**, including:
        * **Iterative Policy Evaluation:**  Uses the Bellman equation to iteratively update the value function for a given policy until convergence.
        * **Policy Improvement Theorem:**  States that for any policy $\pi$, we can find a better policy $\pi^\prime$ by choosing actions greedily with respect to the value function of $\pi$.
    * You'll implement these algorithms and apply them to solve basic gridworld environments, showcasing how to numerically calculate value functions and iteratively improve policies.

**Section 2: Q-Learning & DQN - Mastering CartPole with Deep Neural Networks**

This section introduces **Q-learning**, a model-free algorithm that enables agents to learn optimal actions even when they don't know the environment's dynamics (i.e., the transition probabilities and reward function). It then extends this concept to **Deep Q-learning (DQN)**, using a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function.

* **Q-Learning:**
    * Explains the Q-learning algorithm, which learns a state-action value function (Q-function) that estimates the expected cumulative reward for taking a specific action in a given state.
    * Introduces the **Bellman optimality equation**, which defines the optimal Q-function, and the **Q-learning update rule** for iteratively approximating it based on observed experiences.
    * You'll implement the **SARSA** (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) algorithm, a variant of Q-learning that uses the agent's current policy to choose the next action for updating the Q-function.
    * Compares SARSA and Q-learning on different environments, highlighting their differences in handling exploration and exploitation.
* **DQN:**
    * Extends Q-learning to continuous state spaces by using a deep neural network (the **Deep Q-Network**) to approximate the Q-function.
    * Covers key techniques used in DQN to improve stability and performance, including:
        * **Experience Replay:**  Stores past experiences in a buffer and samples from it randomly to train the network, breaking correlations in the data and improving stability.
        * **Target Network:**  Uses a separate, slowly updated copy of the Q-network to calculate target values, further stabilizing training.
    * Introduces the **CartPole environment** - a classic control problem where the agent must balance a pole on a moving cart.
    * You'll implement a replay buffer and a DQN agent using PyTorch, combining your knowledge of neural networks with RL concepts.
    * The section emphasizes **debugging techniques in RL**, showcasing how to create probe environments with simplified dynamics to test specific aspects of your agent's behavior and isolate potential issues.
    * Discusses the challenges of **reward sparsity**, where the agent receives meaningful rewards only in specific states, and introduces **reward shaping** as a technique to provide more frequent feedback and guide learning.

**Section 3: PPO - Policy Gradient Methods for Enhanced Performance**

This section introduces **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**, a powerful policy gradient algorithm that addresses many of the limitations of DQN, offering improved stability, sample efficiency, and performance in complex environments.

* **Introduction:**
    * Discusses the motivation for using policy gradient methods, which directly optimize the policy instead of indirectly learning a value function like Q-learning.
    * Explains the key challenges addressed by PPO, such as catastrophic forgetting (where the agent forgets previously learned behaviors) and instability in policy updates.
    * Compares PPO to DQN, highlighting their differences in approach and performance.
* **Agent Setup:**
    * Introduces the core components of the PPO algorithm:
        * **Actor Network:**  Learns a policy that maps states to actions, maximizing expected rewards.
        * **Critic Network:**  Learns a value function that estimates the expected cumulative reward from a given state.
        * **Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE):**  A technique for efficiently estimating advantages - the difference between the actual return and the value function's estimate, used to guide policy updates.
        * **Clipped Surrogate Objective:**  A key innovation in PPO that ensures policy updates are small and controlled, improving training stability.
        * **Entropy Bonus:**  Encourages exploration by incentivizing the policy to have higher entropy (i.e., be less deterministic).
    * You'll implement these components, including the GAE calculation, clipped surrogate objective, and entropy bonus.
* **Learning Phase:**
    * Explains the learning phase of the PPO algorithm, where the agent updates its actor and critic networks using sampled experiences from the replay memory.
    * Covers **minibatch updates** and techniques like **gradient clipping** to prevent exploding gradients and further stabilize training.
    * You'll implement the `learning_phase` method, which iterates through minibatches from the replay memory, calculates the objective function (the sum of the clipped surrogate objective, value loss, and entropy bonus), performs backpropagation, updates the agent's parameters using the optimizer, and steps the learning rate scheduler.
* **Training Loop:**
    * Assembles all the pieces into a complete PPO training loop, combining the rollout and learning phases.
    * Guides you through training your PPO agent on the CartPole environment, visualizing its performance with Weights & Biases (WandB).
    * Explores techniques for **reward shaping**, modifying the environment's reward function to guide the agent's learning more effectively and even induce specific behaviors (e.g., making the cartpole spin!).
* **Atari:**
    * Extends PPO to the more complex setting of Atari games, highlighting the necessary adjustments for handling visual observations and larger action spaces.
    * Introduces the concept of **shared architectures** for actor and critic networks, using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the images and separate policy and value heads to map these features to actions and value estimates.
    * You'll implement the Atari-specific architecture and train an agent to solve the Breakout environment.
* **Mujoco:**
    * Applies PPO to continuous action spaces using the MuJoCo physics engine.
    * Covers the necessary changes to the actor network for outputting parameters of a normal distribution (mean and log standard deviation) rather than logits.
    * You'll implement the continuous action space PPO agent and train it on the Hopper environment, a challenging task requiring precise control of a simulated hopping robot.
* **Bonus:**
    * Presents a collection of optional exercises and extension topics, including:
        * Implementing alternative objective functions like **Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)**, which uses constrained optimization to restrict policy updates based on KL divergence.
        * Exploring different replay memory strategies to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
        * Vectorizing the advantage calculation for increased efficiency.
        * Training PPO agents on other environments like Acrobot, MountainCar, LunarLander, and continuous versions of these tasks.
        * Implementing **Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO)** for training multiple agents simultaneously.

* **Introduction:**
    * Explains how the RL framework can be applied to autoregressive transformer language models, where the agent is the model, actions are token predictions, and the environment is the process of generating text.
    * Discusses the core idea of RLHF - using a reward model to provide feedback on the model's generated text, guiding it towards producing more desirable outputs.
    * Introduces the concept of a **value head**, a separate component added to the transformer that outputs a value estimate for each token, effectively turning the transformer into both an actor and a critic with shared architecture.
* **RLHF Implementation:**
    * You'll implement a `TransformerWithValueHead` class, extending a standard TransformerLens model with a value head.
    * Develops a function for generating samples from the model, which will be evaluated by the reward function.

* **Training Loop:**
    * Builds a full RLHF training loop using a `RLHFTrainer` class, incorporating elements from the PPO algorithm (clipped surrogate objective, value loss, entropy bonus) and a KL penalty term to prevent the model's policy from diverging too far from the reference model.
    * You'll train a transformer using the "maximize output of periods" reward function, observing and understanding the phenomenon of **mode collapse**, where the model gets stuck in a suboptimal solution that easily maximizes reward.
    * Explores training with different reward functions (e.g., maximizing sentiment based on a pre-trained sentiment classifier) and analyzing the resulting model behavior.
* **Bonus:**
    * Presents optional exercises and further directions for exploration, including:
        * Training RLHF on larger language models, utilizing techniques like differential learning rates and frozen layers to handle increased complexity and memory constraints.
        * Exploring hyperparameter sweeps and adaptive KL penalties to improve training efficiency and stability.
